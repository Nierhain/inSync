Stop tearing up your heart about changing modpacks
Ever wanted to start a new modpack without losing all your stuff? Trouble finding a pack you stick with and jumping from sink to sink? Fear not, rescue's coming!

This mod is intended to bridge a gap between switching Minecraft versions, modpacks or even worlds in that you can choose to take items, achievements, experience or statistics with your character when switching from one to the other. Much like how characters in Terraria work.
