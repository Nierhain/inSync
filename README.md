#### Stop tearing up your heart about changing modpacks
Ever wanted to start a new modpack without losing all your stuff? Trouble finding a pack
you stick with and jumping from sink to sink? Fear not, rescue's coming!

This mod is intended to bridge a gap between switching Minecraft versions, modpacks or even worlds in that you
can choose to take items, achievements, experience or statistics with your character when switching from one to
the other. Much like how characters in Terraria work.

### How to use

1. create a Scanner to register what you want to take with you
2. copy the output string
3. paste it into the printer in the desired world/pack/version you want to play now
4. enjoy your stuff

## Features

- Copy items, achievements, character stats or other things from one world to another
